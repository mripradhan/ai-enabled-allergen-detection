# ai-enabled-allergen-detection
Our preliminary submission for the Craft-N'-Code Hackathon, focusing on AI-Enabled Detection of Allergens. 

Our solution addresses the Automated Auditing Tools track. The specific problem is ensuring accurate allergen detection and labeling through AI-based systems that automatically analyze ingredient compositions and cross-reference them with allergen databases. This eliminates the need for manual checks, reducing human error and ensuring compliance with food safety standards during quality control audits.
