# AI Enabled Allergen Detection
Our preliminary submission for the Craft-N'-Code Hackathon, focusing on AI-Enabled Detection of Allergens. 

Our solution addresses the Automated Auditing Tools track. 

The specific problem statement is to ensure accurate allergen detection and labeling through AI-based systems. We aim to automatically analyze ingredient compositions and cross-reference them with allergen databases. This eliminates the need for manual checks, reducing human error and ensuring compliance with food safety standards during quality control audits.
